# Programming Assignment for Evolutionary Computing - Group 63
This repository contains all code that was used to generate the results as reported in our research article.
The evolutionary algorithm is written in Java.

To build the project run `build.py` with python (3.7 or higher). The code can then be run with `run.py` for individual functions/parameters or `run_experiment.sh` to run it as was done for the article.
Using `run_experiment.py` will create a directory called `results` containing all plots and scores.
